            <textarea name="Feedback" id="Feedback" rows="15"
                cols="125">The "Software Development and Applications" course was incredibly well-structured and impactful. It covered a perfect mix of foundational concepts and practical applications. Starting with the basics like data types, variables, and input/output operations, and gradually moving into advanced topics like object-oriented programming and web development, the progression felt seamless and well-paced.

The inclusion of topics like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Agile methodologies, and working with data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues provided a solid understanding of both theory and practice. The hands-on exercises and the capstone project were especially helpful in applying these skills and really brought everything together.

What stood out the most was how clearly even complex topics like regular expressions or pointers were explained. The practical approach to teaching, with coding assignments and real-world examples, made the learning process much more engaging. Overall, the course was a great blend of theory, coding, and project work that has significantly enhanced my programming knowledge.</textarea>

        <h3>SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)</h3>
        <section>
            <p>The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process/method that a developer/team of development uses
                in order to build high quality softwares.The aim of SDLC is to reduce any project risks by forward
                planning so that it meets expectations of the customers even after tghe completion of the project. It
                consists series of steps that divides the process of development into several parts that you can assign
                or complete in the given time frame. It generally consists of the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Plan</li>
                <li>Design</li>
                <li>Implement</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Deploy</li>
                <li>Maintain</li>
            </ol>
            In today's digital era, every technology is getting rapid upgraded, hence it is difficult to maintain and
            manage the constant changing requirements. This is where SDLC comes into play. It provides a systematic
            management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. As a
            result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan
            to achieve those goals.

            <p>Even among all these methodologies, I would prefer Agile. And even in Agile I would choose the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Kanban: A visual Agile approach that manages work using a Kanban board. emphasizes continuous
                    delivery rather than set sprints. Best suited for teams that don't require time-boxed iterations and
                    prioritize flexibility.
                </li>
                <li>Scrum: A branch of Agile that emphasizes sprints and well defined roles (e.g., Product Owner, Scrum
                    Master). The work is arranged in brief, time-boxed iterations, usually lasting two to four weeks.
                    Ideal for groups seeking regular feedback cycles and organization.</li>
                <li>Extreme Programming (XP): Engineering techniques to enhance software quality and adaptability to
                    evolving needs.
                    Ideal for groups who require superior technical performance and deliverables in hectic settings.
                </li>
                <li>Feature-driven development (FDD): Iteratively developing and delivering features while adhering to a
                    well defined methodology.
                    Ideal for big groups working on intricate projects where the main output is features.</li>
                <li>Lean: This strategy, which was influenced by lean manufacturing, emphasizes producing value through
                    waste reduction and process optimization. Suitable for groups seeking low overhead and simple
                    procedures.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In this Software Development course of <a href="https://www.srh-university.de/de/">SRH University of
                    Applied Science</a> we
                learned about the following methods

            <p>I have used CSS .....There are 3 ways to include CSS in a webpage as follows:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Inline Styles</li>
                <li>Style Tag (In Head)</li>
                <li>External Stylesheet</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>The reason CSS is used in a webpage are:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>To make them visually attractive, responsive and colorful </li>
                <li>To edit the elements of HTML according to your page layout/screen layout</li>
                <li>Reuseability of code and linking of multiple HTML files</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>We also use JS in webpage, the main reason are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>To make our website/webpage interactive</li>
                <li>It can handle the logic directly in the browser hence, reducing the server side interactions</li>
                <li>We get improved user experince like transitions and animations, real time suggestions</li>
                <li>Fetch API to communicate with servers asynchronously</li>
                <li>We can also handle events using JavaScript</li>
                <li>With the use of Node.js, we can use JavaScript for backend as well</li>
            </ol>
